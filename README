This repository will contain algorithms that I've found useful,
and that may be useful to other people.

Right now, the only algorithm in the repository is a C++ implementation
of the Hungarian algorithm for computing minimum perfect matchings.
Given a complete, weighted bipartite graph with n vertices on each side,
this algorithm returns a matching of the vertices with minimum total weight.

This algorithm comes up in a whole host of sitations.
For example, I recently found it to be useful as a subroutine in a game:
I had n sprites and n positions I wanted them to occupy, and I used the
algorithm to move each sprite to a position such that the total distance
that they all moved was minimized. In this case, the vertices were the
sprites and positions and the weight of an edge was the distance between.

The algorithm comes in a simple header-only library with almost no dependencies.
It's also in the PUBLIC DOMAIN, so please do whatever you like with it!
I want the barrier to including this in your project to be as low as possible.
